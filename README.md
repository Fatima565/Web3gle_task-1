# Data Processing Pipeline Project

## Overview
Welcome to my Data Processing Pipeline Project! In this project, I demonstrate a comprehensive data processing pipeline, covering various stages from data loading and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and applying a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. My goal is to provide a robust framework for efficiently handling real-world data processing tasks.

## Files Included
- **Data_Processing_Pipeline.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire data processing pipeline.
- **example_data_with_target.csv**: This sample dataset is used within the notebook to demonstrate the pipeline's functionality.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Requirements
To run this project, please ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
Install Required Libraries:
Next, install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
Finally, launch Jupyter Notebook and open the provided notebook file:


jupyter notebook Data_Processing_Pipeline.ipynb
In this project, I follow a structured workflow that includes the following stages:

1. Data Loading
Firstly, I create and load a sample dataset into a pandas DataFrame for processing.

2. Data Cleaning
Secondly, I clean the data by removing any duplicate entries to ensure data quality, providing a clean dataset for analysis.

3. Handling Missing Values
Thirdly, I handle missing values in numeric columns using the mean strategy, ensuring a complete dataset for further analysis.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Fourthly, I perform EDA to understand the data better. This includes generating descriptive statistics and visualizations:

Descriptive Statistics: I compute summary statistics for numeric features.
Histograms: I create histograms to visualize the distributions of numeric features.
Correlation Matrix Heatmap: I generate a heatmap to visualize correlations between numeric features.
5. Outlier Detection
Fifthly, I detect and handle outliers using the Z-score method, removing data points significantly different from the rest of the data.

6. KNN Model Application
Finally, I apply a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to the dataset. I evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Conclusion
In this project, I successfully demonstrate a full-fledged data processing pipeline, from data loading to applying a KNN classifier. The provided notebook and dataset showcase the pipeline's functionality, offering a robust framework for handling and analyzing real-world data.
